# Phylo Benchmark Set

This repository contains hypergraphs from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data.
The hypergraphs originally where created for [HyperPhylo](https://github.com/lukashuebner/HyperPhylo) in the _repeats_ format.
The original files can be found [here](https://github.com/lukashuebner/HyperPhylo/tree/master/datasets/extracted).
We converted them to the _hMetis_ format to use them as input for [MtKaHyPar](https://github.com/kahypar/mt-kahypar/tree/judicious_refinement).

# Experimental Results

We also include the experimental results.
The folders indicate which part of the multilevel scheme was evaluated.
The setup is described in our publication (reference coming soon).
