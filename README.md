# Phylo Benchmark Set

This repository contains hypergraphs from multiple sequence alignment (MSA) data.
The hypergraphs originally where created for [HyperPhylo](https://github.com/lukashuebner/HyperPhylo/dataset/extracted).
We converted them to the hMetis format to use them as input for [MtKaHyPar](https://github.com/kahypar/mt-kahypar/tree/judicious_refinement).
